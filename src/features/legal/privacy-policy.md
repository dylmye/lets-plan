If you have logged in: if you choose to sync your trip, the details are securely stored remotely to enable you to access this data from other devices. The details are encrypted and Google cannot read them.                                                                                                                                                                     |

They use the text you provide to give you search results, and to help improve their service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Interactions with hCaptcha                                   | (3)              | hCaptcha protects the website against bots and other bad actors. It does this by anonymously, automatically checking "information like mouse movements, scroll position, keypress events, touch events, and gyroscope / accelerometer information as applicable." None of this data is stored, it is only used to determine if you're legitimate or not.                                                                                                    |

This data is retained for "a few months."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Non-personal data about your visit                           | (4)              | A minimal amount of non-personal information (list [here](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/metrics)) is collected to help improve _Let's Plan_ and understand how it's being used.

| Interactions with 'paid links'                               | (6), (7)         | Paid links provide revenue to _Let's Plan_ by linking purchases you make through the link back to _Let's Plan_.

If you don't click on the link, you don't transfer any data to the AMs. AWIN AM retains link attribution data for 36 months.                                      |
| Account Login Details                                        | (1)              | When you sign in to Let's Plan using a third-party provider, like Twitter or Google, we store an identifier for your account so we know what account to associate your data with. This information is never used for any other purposes. If you create an account with a username and password, we store this information securely and only use it for account-related purposes, including associating your data with you and verifying your email address. |

## How do we get this information?

We receive the above information from you when you:

- Input data in forms, like the Create Trip form,
- Interact with hCaptcha fields,
- Click on tracked links (marked with an "AD" label),
- And visit the website.

## How do we store that information?

- All offline data, like trips not connected to an account, is stored on your device using [IndexedDB technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Basic_Terminology), that only lets the _Let's Plan_ website access it.
- All trips linked to an account are stored securely (encrypted and access restricted) on Google servers.
- All other data is stored according to the privacy policies of the relevant partners.
